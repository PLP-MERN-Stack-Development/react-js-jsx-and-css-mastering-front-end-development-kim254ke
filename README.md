# TaskMaster Pro: Comprehensive React/Tailwind Application

This project is a single-page application built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS** to demonstrate mastery of modern front-end concepts.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### 1. Task Master (Home Page)
A fully functional To-Do list application with state persisted via the browser's Local Storage.
* **CRUD Operations:** Add, delete, and toggle tasks as complete.
* **Filtering:** Users can view **All**, **Active**, or **Completed** tasks.
* **Custom Hook:** Uses a custom `useLocalStorageTasks` hook for persistence, fulfilling the `useContext` requirement.

### 2. API Data Viewer
A dedicated page for integrating with an external data source.
* **API Source:** Fetches post data from `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`.
* **Search Feature:** Instantly filters the displayed list by post title.
* **Pagination:** Implements a controlled "Load More" button to fetch and append the next batch of data.
* **Loading Indicators:** Displays a prominent **spiral loader** on initial fetch and an integrated **spinner** on the "Load More" button (with a simulated 2-second delay) for enhanced UX.

### 3. User Interface & Architecture
* **Dark Mode:** A persistent theme switcher in the `Navbar` uses Tailwind's `dark:` modifier and a React Context (`ThemeContext`) to manage global state.
* **Reusable Components:** Includes a versatile `Button` component with `primary`, `secondary`, and `danger` variants, plus integrated loading state.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled with Tailwind CSS to be functional and appealing on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
